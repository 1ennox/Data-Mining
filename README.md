### Individual Project

**1-1   Random number generation:**

1-1.1         Generate three streams (1D, 2D and 3D) of random numbers with 1,000 samples, you may use the Matlab command rand.

1-1.2         Visualize the generated samples, you may use a scatterplot.

1-1.3         Compute the histogram of the three streams, then normalize them to become a probability density function (pdf).

1-1.4         Visualize the pdf’s of the three streams. Are the samples uniformly distributed? Do the pdf’s represent a standard uniform distributions? Comment.

 

**1-2   Image manipulation – the image LenaGrey is formed by 512x512 pixels with intensity from 0 to 255**

1-2.1         Import LenaGrey to show and see the image.

1-2.2         Calculate its mean, standard deviation, median, min, max, and mode.

1-2.3         Plot the histogram of the LenaGrey.

1-2.4         With the intensity as the third dimension (normalize it), plot its 3D shape (although this is not its 3D shape but it has some 3D impression.

 

**1-3   Image range reduction – partition image intensity range into several bins and check to see how the image appearance change**

1-3.1         Partition image intensity into 2 bins, i.e., change the image to 1 bit image (binary image)

1-3.2         Partition image intensity into 3. 4, 5, 6, 7 bins to check image quality change compared with the original Lena image (8 bit image with intensity range from 0 to 255).
